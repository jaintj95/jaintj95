# 🗂️ Projects

**[SageMaker Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/jaintj95/SageMaker_SentimentAnalysis)**

- Deployed a LSTM model to Amazon SageMaker that collects data from a WebApp and performs inference on it.
- Review from Web App is sent to Lambda function via API Gateway.
- Lambda function invokes SageMaker endpoint where inference is performed and output is returned.

**[DCGAN Face Generator](https://github.com/jaintj95/DCGAN_FaceGenerator)**

- Trained a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network on a dataset of celebrity faces.
- Experimented with Discriminators and Generators of various depths, BatchNorm layers and loss functions to produce a model that generates realistic faces.

**[Behavioral Cloning for Self-Driving Cars](https://github.com/jaintj95/BehavioralCloning)**

- Replicated nVidia's Deep Learning model to teach a car how to drive after learning from human driving behaviour.
- Model learns steering angles over various turns & maintains the car in center lane in autonomous mode.

**[Bounty Hub dApp (Blockchain Bootcamp Capstone Project)](https://github.com/jaintj95/Consensys_Ethereum_dApp)**

- An app that allows Job Posters to post bounties or projects and Freelancers to submit work in exchange for the bounty amount.
- This Decentralized App (Smart Contract) is written in Solidity & capable of being deployed on ETH Mainnet.

**[Advanced Lane detection for Self-Driving Cars](https://github.com/jaintj95/AdvancedLaneFinding)**

- Designed a Lane detection algorithm using Python and OpenCV.
- Implemented Computer Vision concepts such as Distortion Correction, Camera Calibration, Perspective Transform etc.
- Experimented with different Colour spaces and Edge detection techniques.

**[Extended Kalman Filters](https://github.com/jaintj95/Extended-Kalman-Filters)**

- Designed & implemented a Sensor Fusion Algorithm in C++.
- Algorithm is based on Extended Kalman Filters for object tracking in Autonomous Vehicles.

**[TV Script Generation using LSTM and Embeddings](https://github.com/jaintj95/RNN_TV_script_generator)**

- Used a LSTM network & Word Embeddings to generate TV script.
- Explored NLP topics such as Tokenization, Subsampling etc.

**[Spam Detection using Naive Bayes](https://github.com/jaintj95/Naive_Bayes_Spam_Detector)**

- Built a Spam Classifier to detect Spam emails based on Naive Bayes theorem.
- Implemented Bag of Words transformation from scratch.

**IoT based Smart Street Lighting System** (B.E. Final Year Project: July 2016 - April 2017) 

A Proof-of-concept Smart Street Lighting system. The FRDM-KL25Z microcontroller is housed on street lights 5kms apart. It collects ambient lighting data throughout the day and uploads it to a phant server. The collected data can be analysed by Machine Learning algorithms and then used to toggle the street lamps to save power.

# 💼 Work Experience

## Research Engineer

***[OpenMined](https://github.com/openmined),** Remote (Freelancing)*

Role: Private AI Course Mentor

(January 2021 - Present)

-	OpenMined's Private AI Course series was designed to educate everyone on the impact of privacy in every industry and how to build real-world products with privacy-preserving AI technology

Role: Research Engineer

(April 2020 - July 2020)

- OpenMined's Research Programme involves collaboration between Research Engineers and Research Scientists for researching and publishing papers on Machine Learning under the umbrella of OpenMined.
- I collaborated with a Research Scientist on a paper related to Federated Machine Learning. The goal was to perform a distributed injection of adversarial samples during the training phase to successfully poison the final model aggregated at the central server.

## Machine Learning Mentor

***Udacity,** Remote (Contract)*

Role: Independent Consultant

(March 2019 - Present)

-	As a consultant, I utilize my specialized knowledge in Machine Learning to provide project reviews and other student support services.
-	I have mentored more than 200 students so far and provided personalized reviews for 1050+ project submissions and 700+ student queries.
-	Recognized and applauded for my hard work in [Udacity’s June 2020 Newsletter](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/m-and-r-newsletter-archive/june-2020-newsletter).
-	One of the winners of [Answer Rate Acceptance Challenge](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/m-and-r-newsletter-archive/november-2020-newsletter) (November 2020).
-	[Winner of Mentor Community Award](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/m-and-r-newsletter-archive/january-2021-newsletter) - peer mentors nominated me for my contribution to community and the quality of reviews I provide to Udacity students (December 2020).
-	[Spotlight Mentor/Reviewer](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/m-and-r-newsletter-archive/january-2021-newsletter) (January 2021).

## Assistant Systems Engineer

***Tata Consultancy Services**, Mumbai* 

Role: Junior Developer, Payments Module

(July 2017 - October 2018)

**Brexit Migration**

- Praised by clients for deploying more than 20 DPUs, three months ahead of schedule. All DPUs ran successfully on production environment without any major issues.
- Migrated 12 critical file transfer interfaces under this module, aiding the clients in accelerating their migration process.
- Rescheduled pre-configured jobs in system queue, speeding up the total file transfer time by more than a minute.

**Utilities Automation** 

- Worked on Pathway Automation Project that completely automated the client-side package installation process and led to a massive decrease in installation issues faced by clients.
- Automated critical monthly reporting utilities using Excel VBA macros. This led to more than 70% reduction in manual effort.
