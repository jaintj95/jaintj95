# 🗂️ Projects

**[Deep RL (DQN) Agent](https://github.com/jaintj95/DeepQAgent_RL)**

- Trained a Reinforcement Learning Agent to navigate a UnityML environment and play the Banana collection game.
- The RL agent is based on a Deep-Q network consisting of 3 linear layers.

**[Advanced Lane detection for Self-Driving Cars](https://github.com/jaintj95/AdvancedLaneFinding)**

- Designed a Lane detection algorithm using Python and OpenCV.
- Implemented Computer Vision concepts such as Distortion Correction, Camera Calibration, Perspective Transform etc.
- Experimented with different Colour spaces and Edge detection techniques.

**[Bounty Hub dApp (Blockchain Bootcamp Capstone Project)](https://github.com/jaintj95/Consensys_Ethereum_dApp)**

- An app that allows Job Posters to post bounties or projects and Freelancers to submit work in exchange for the bounty amount.
- This Decentralized App (Smart Contract) is written in Solidity & capable of being deployed on ETH Mainnet.

**[DCGAN Face Generator](https://github.com/jaintj95/DCGAN_FaceGenerator)**

- Trained a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network on a dataset of celebrity faces.
- Experimented with Discriminators and Generators of various depths, BatchNorm layers and loss functions to produce a model that generates realistic faces.

**[Extended Kalman Filters](https://github.com/jaintj95/Extended-Kalman-Filters)**

- Designed & implemented a Sensor Fusion Algorithm in C++.
- Algorithm is based on Extended Kalman Filters for object tracking in Autonomous Vehicles.

**[Behavioral Cloning for Self-Driving Cars](https://github.com/jaintj95/BehavioralCloning)**

- Replicated nVidia's Deep Learning model to teach a car how to drive after learning from human driving behaviour.
- Model learns steering angles over various turns & maintains the car in center lane in autonomous mode.

**[TV Script Generation using LSTM and Embeddings](https://github.com/jaintj95/RNN_TV_script_generator)**

- Used a LSTM network & Word Embeddings to generate TV script.
- Explored NLP topics such as Tokenization, Subsampling etc.

**[SageMaker Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/jaintj95/SageMaker_SentimentAnalysis)**

- Deployed a LSTM model to Amazon SageMaker that collects data from a WebApp and performs inference on it.
- Review from Web App is sent to Lambda function via API Gateway.
- Lambda function invokes SageMaker endpoint where inference is performed and output is returned.

**[Spam Detection using Naive Bayes](https://github.com/jaintj95/Naive_Bayes_Spam_Detector)**

- Built a Spam Classifier to detect Spam emails based on Naive Bayes theorem.
- Implemented Bag of Words transformation from scratch.

**IoT based Smart Street Lighting System** (B.E. Final Year Project: July 2016 - April 2017) 

A Proof-of-concept Smart Street Lighting system. The FRDM-KL25Z microcontroller is housed on street lights 5kms apart. It collects ambient lighting data throughout the day and uploads it to a phant server. The collected data can be analysed by Machine Learning algorithms and then used to toggle the street lamps to save power.

- I have mentored more than 100 students so far. I primarily guide them through complex Machine Learning topics and help them pass their courses successfully.

## Assistant Systems Engineer

***Tata Consultancy Services**, Mumbai* 

Role: Junior Developer, Payments Module

(July 2017 - October 2018)

**Brexit Migration**

- Praised by clients for deploying more than 20 DPUs, three months ahead of schedule. All DPUs ran successfully on production environment without any major issues.
- Migrated 12 critical file transfer interfaces under this module, aiding the clients in accelerating their migration process.
- Rescheduled pre-configured jobs in system queue, speeding up the total file transfer time by more than a minute.

**Utilities Automation** 

- Worked on Pathway Automation Project that completely automated the client-side package installation process and led to a massive decrease in installation issues faced by clients.
- Automated critical monthly reporting utilities using Excel VBA macros. This led to more than 70% reduction in manual effort.
